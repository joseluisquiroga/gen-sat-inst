Factorial Benchmark for SAT-solvers and Stable Model Semantics solvers
======================================================================

This package contains a generator of factorial benchmarks for different
solvers. It is able to produce problem instances in smodels- and dimacs-
formats. This package has been tested to work under Debian Linux 
operating system, but it is expected to work also under different 
flavors of Unix. 

This package is based on the problem of factoring, i.e., finding
numbers which when multiplied produce some given number. This package
approaches this problem by constructing problem instances
corresponding well-known multiplier circuits having their outputs
hardcoded. The way to satisfy such instance, is to find the valuation
for inputs. . Outputs may be hardcoded to prime numbers, corresponding
unsatisfiable instances, or composite numbers, corresponding one or
two solutions.

It uses GNU multi-precision library, which has to be installed prior to 
installing this package. To use this package, you need at least 
version 3.0 of this library. 

To build and install package use commands
> make 
> make install

Once installed, you are able to create problem instances using the 
command
> genfacbm [smodels|dimacs|bcsat] [type] [atree|braun] width seed

As parameters you define the output format, the type of instance, which
is sat(isfiable), unsat(isfiable) or 4,8,16,32,64,128,256 or 512 being the 
amount of the solutions to the instance, and the multiplier circuit design
for the instance (atree/braun). The expected computational effort
depends mostly on the width of the instance. This specifies the size
of the number to be factored in bits. Seed specifies which of
instances at this width shall be produced. The instances differ by the
hardcoded number. The instance will be output to standard output.
